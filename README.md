This project is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents, extract text from them, and ask questions about their content. The application utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to answer questions based on the extracted text.

Features:
  -PDF Upload: Users can upload PDF documents for processing.
  -Text Extraction: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
  -Question-Answering: Users can ask questions about the uploaded document, and the application will return relevant answers based on the document content using NLP.
